# Learning NodeJS

This repository is used solely for learning NodeJS.

## Lesson 1 :gear:

**NodeJS** according to the main website is a bit confusing.

### NodeJS is actually...

- A platform which allows us to run JavaScript on a computer or server
  - This is cool because it allows us to not use server-side languages such as PHP and Ruby to run on server
  - We can just use **JavaScript** instead
- Read, delete and update files
- Easily communicate with a database

### Why is Node.js so Popular?

- It uses JavaScript
- Very fast (runs on V8 engine and non-blocking code)
- Huge ecosystem of open source packages (npm)
- Great for real-time services (like chats)
